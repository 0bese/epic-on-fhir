# Epic on FHIR

This project demonstrates a healthcare interoperability solution that leverages OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication and enables FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) queries to access and interact with healthcare data.

## üöÄ **About the Application**

The application focuses on seamless and secure data exchange in healthcare settings. Here's how it works:

1. **OAuth 2.0 Login via Epic**: Users authenticate through Epic's OAuth 2.0 mechanism, ensuring secure access to their healthcare data.
2. **Redirection and Token Handling**: After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application with a token.
3. **FHIR Queries**: Using the token, the application makes FHIR-compliant API requests to access and manipulate healthcare resources like patients, observations, and appointments.

The project is designed to showcase real-time or near real-time healthcare data access while adhering to industry standards for interoperability and data security.
